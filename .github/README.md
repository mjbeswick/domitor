### 6. Code Quality (`code-quality.yml`)

**Triggers:** Push to main/develop, Pull requests to main/develop

**Jobs:**

- **Lint and Format:** Code quality checks
  - Runs ESLint
  - Checks TypeScript
  - Checks for security vulnerabilities
  - Checks bundle size

- **Coverage:** Test coverage
  - Runs tests with coverage
  - Uploads coverage to Codecov

## Required Secrets

For the release workflow to work, you need to set up the following secrets in your GitHub repository:

1. **NPM_TOKEN:** Your NPM authentication token for publishing packages
2. **GITHUB_TOKEN:** Automatically provided by GitHub

## Setup Instructions

1. **Enable GitHub Pages:**
   - Go to repository Settings > Pages
   - Set source to "Deploy from a branch"
   - Select "gh-pages" branch
   - Save

2. **Set up NPM publishing:**
   - Create an NPM account if you don't have one
   - Generate an NPM token with publish permissions
   - Add the token as `NPM_TOKEN` secret in GitHub

3. **Enable Codecov (optional):**
   - Sign up at codecov.io
   - Connect your GitHub repository
   - The coverage will be automatically uploaded

## Local Development

To run the same checks locally:

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run tests
npm test

# Run linting
npm run lint

# Check TypeScript
npm run type-check

# Security audit
npm run security-audit

# Build library
npm run build
```

## Workflow Status

You can monitor the status of all workflows in the "Actions" tab of your GitHub repository. Each workflow will show:

- ‚úÖ **Green:** All checks passed
- ‚ùå **Red:** One or more checks failed
- üü° **Yellow:** Workflow is running

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Tests failing:** Check that all dependencies are properly installed
2. **Build failing:** Ensure TypeScript compilation is successful
3. **Linting errors:** Run `npm run lint` locally to see issues
4. **Security vulnerabilities:** Run `npm audit` to see details

### Manual Triggers

You can manually trigger workflows from the Actions tab:

1. Go to Actions tab
2. Select the workflow you want to run
3. Click "Run workflow"
4. Select the branch and click "Run workflow"
